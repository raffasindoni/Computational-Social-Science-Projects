    "MODEL 1: Lasso Model: \n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso model is a linear regression method that adds a regularization term, which penalizes regression coefficients (effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero). This makes it a solid choice for this diabetes dataset with a ton of census varibales which may or may not be effective in helping us predict what we're looking for here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLasso is useful when you have many variables, but you suspect that not all of them are useful predictors for diabetes. Lasso automatically selects the most important features by shrinking some coefficients to zero, which simplifies the model and reduces the chance of overfitting. This is a great model to use here where we are not sure about what is relevant and what is not out of all the variables wer are presented with. \n",
    "\t•\tPrevents overfitting: The regularization can help prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from fitting too closely to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tBias in coefficient estimates: Since Lasso shrinks coefficients, it can introduce bias into the model. In some cases, this can mean that the estimated coefficients are further from the true values than they would be with standard linear regression.\n",
    "\t•\t\tMay exclude important features: If the penalty (alpha) is set too high, Lasso can shrink coefficients for important features down to zero, which could result in the model missing key relationships in the data. Hopefully making alpha smaller will fix this. \n",
    "\t•\tHandling collinearity: Lasso doesn’t handle collinearity as well as Ridge regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###########\n",
    "MODEL 2: Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a basic model that estimates the relationship between predictors and the dependent var by fitting a straight line. It assumes a linear relationship between features and the target, making it simple but sometimes limited in handling complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tInterpretable: Linear regression is straightforward and easy to interpret, making it easy to see the effect of each feature on the target.\n",
    "\t•\tLow Bias: It has low bias since it captures direct, linear relationships well without adding complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tSensitive to Outliers: Linear regression can be heavily influenced by outliers, which can distort predictions.\n",
    "\t•\tOverfitting Risk with Many Features: Without regularization, linear regression can overfit the training data, especially when there are a lot of features.\n",
    "\t•\tLimited to Linear Relationships: This model struggles when the relationship between features and the target is non-linear, which may reduce its performance on real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###########\n",
    "MODEL 3: Ridge: \n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is a regularized form of linear regression that adds a penalty term, shrinking coefficients towards zero, which helps prevent overfitting. Ridge regression is useful when we have some features with collinearity, since it stabilizes coefficient estimates without removing them entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tHandles Collinearity: Reduces impact of correlated features rather than eliminating them, which can lead to more stable and reliable predictions.\n",
    "\t•\tReduces Overfitting: Regularization helps prevent overfitting by shrinking coefficients - good when working with high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tBias Introduction: Regularization term can introduce bias into  model \n",
    "\t•\tDoes Not Perform Feature Selection: Unlike Lasso, Ridge does not zero out coefficients, so it does not simplify the model by removing unimportant features.\n",

For this project, balancing bias and variance is key because it determines how well our model generalizes to new data, which is the ultimate goal."

    "Based on my analysis, the major predictors of diabetes rates in these counties are factors like obesity, physical inactivity, and some demographic characteristics, especially age and race composition. For a pilot program, I’d recommend zeroing in on counties with high obesity and inactivity rates, especially in more elderly areas, since these variables showed the strongest link to diabetes prevalence, suggesting that interventions targeting these areas could be the most impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we bring race into the picture, there’s an additional layer to consider. The data suggests disparities between Hispanic and white populations in terms of diabetes risk, so it might make sense to consider this context in our strategy. While age can be useful as an indicator (since older populations generally have a higher diabetes risk), using race directly as a targeting criterion is more complicated. We don’t want to reinforce existing inequalities or make assumptions about individual risk based on demographic averages. Instead, I’d focus primarily on modifiable health factors (like obesity, age, or activity levels) and use demographic information as a layer of context, acknowledging disparities without making race the main driver of targeting.\n",

    "Overall, I feel fairly confident deploying this model in a real-world setting if it could be sucesfully validated with larger social theories or medical accounts that help us understand why, indeed, diabetes could be linked to certain race and age factors.
