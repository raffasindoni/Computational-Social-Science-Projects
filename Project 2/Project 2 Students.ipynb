    "\n",
    "The Lasso model is a linear regression method that adds a regularization term, which penalizes regression coefficients (effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero). This makes it a solid choice for this diabetes dataset with a ton of census varibales which may or may not be effective in helping us predict what we're looking for here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLasso is useful when you have many variables, but you suspect that not all of them are useful predictors for diabetes. Lasso automatically selects the most important features by shrinking some coefficients to zero, which simplifies the model and reduces the chance of overfitting. This is a great model to use here where we are not sure about what is relevant and what is not out of all the variables wer are presented with. \n",
    "\t•\tPrevents overfitting: The regularization can help prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from fitting too closely to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tBias in coefficient estimates: Since Lasso shrinks coefficients, it can introduce bias into the model. In some cases, this can mean that the estimated coefficients are further from the true values than they would be with standard linear regression.\n",
    "\t•\t\tMay exclude important features: If the penalty (alpha) is set too high, Lasso can shrink coefficients for important features down to zero, which could result in the model missing key relationships in the data. Hopefully making alpha smaller will fix this. \n",
    "\t•\tHandling collinearity: Lasso doesn’t handle collinearity as well as Ridge regression.\n",
